# Networking basics #1

This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

# Tasks 📃

• 0. Change your home IP

    ° 0-change_your_home_IP: Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server as follows:
    ° localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
    ° facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8

• 1. Show attached IPs

    ° 1-show_attached_IPs: Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IP's on the machine.

• 100. Port listening on localhost

    ° 100-port_listening_on_localhost: Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
