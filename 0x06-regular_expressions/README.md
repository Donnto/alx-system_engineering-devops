# Regular expression
In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. I practiced building them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

# Tasks 📃
Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line.

• 0. Simply matching School

    ° 0-simply_match_school.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression School.

• 1. Repetition Token #0

    ° 1-repetition_token_0.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with between 2-5 t's in between hb and n.

• 2. Repetition Token #1

    ° 2-repetition_token_1.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hn with 0 or 1 occurrences of b and 0 or 1 occurrences of t in between h and n.

• 3. Repetition Token #2

    ° 3-repetition_token_2.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with 1 or more t's in between hb and n.

• 4. Repetition Token #3

    ° 4-repetition_token_3.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with 0 or more t's in between hb and n.

• 5. Not quite HBTN yet

    ° 5-beginning_and_end.rb: Ruby script that matches a regular expression starting with h and ending with n with any single character in between.

• 6. Call me maybe

    ° 6-phone_number.rb: Ruby script that matches a regular expression representing a 10-digit phone number.

• 7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?

    ° 7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb: Ruby script that matches regular expressions of uppercase letters.

• 8. Textme

 ° 100-textme.rb: Ruby script that runs statistics on TextMe app text message transcations.

 ° Output: [SENDER],[RECEIVER],[FLAGS] where

    • [SENDER] is the sender phone number or name (including country code if present).

    • [RECEIVER] is the receiver phone number or name (including country code if present).

    • [FLAGS] is the flags that were used.
